# Student-Records-DB-app
Student Records DB is an desktop application designed for a Primary School for storing student records.
A CRUD application which allows creation of new records, read, update and delete of records.
A database is not used in this design. Storage is by sequential file access, and records are grouped and 
saved to file. It is for the user to navigate and create a folder for the storage of files.
Application size (the .jar) is 108kb. 

The project is primarily a vehicle for learning persistence. In this design, storage is by sequential file access, but
the next design will be with Random File access and ultimately a version linking to a Database and using JDBC (java database
connectivity).
